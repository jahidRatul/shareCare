# share_care

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Here's an example of how you could apply MVVM with clean architecture to create a book sharing app
for students:

Domain layer: Define the entities and use cases that represent the business logic of your app. For a
book sharing app, your entities might include Book, User, and Transaction. Your use cases might
include Search for Books, Add a Book, Request a Book, and Accept a Request.

Data layer: Implement the use cases defined in the domain layer. Use repositories to abstract away
the data sources. Your repositories might include a FirestoreRepository for storing and retrieving
book data, a UserRepository for storing and retrieving user data, and a TransactionRepository for
managing book transactions.

Presentation layer: Create the view models that handle the logic and state of your UI. For a book
sharing app, you might have a BookListViewModel that handles the list of available books, a
BookDetailsViewModel that handles the details of a selected book, a AddBookViewModel that handles
adding a new book, a RequestBookViewModel that handles requesting a book, and a
AcceptRequestViewModel that handles accepting a book request.

Implement your views: Implement the views that display the UI of your app. For a book sharing app,
you might have a BookListView that displays the list of available books, a BookDetailsView that
displays the details of a selected book, a AddBookView that allows users to add a new book, a
RequestBookView that allows users to request a book, and a AcceptRequestView that allows users to
accept a book request.

Use data binding to connect your views and view models: Use data binding libraries like Provider or
Riverpod to connect your views and view models. For example, your BookListView might observe the
state of your BookListViewModel and update itself accordingly. When a user taps on a book, the
BookDetailsView might navigate to the BookDetailsViewModel and display the details of the selected
book.

By using MVVM with clean architecture, you can create a scalable and maintainable book sharing app
for students that is easy to test and modify.
